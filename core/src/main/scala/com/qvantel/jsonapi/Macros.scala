/**
  * Contains macros used to automatically create JsonApiWriter and JsonApiFormat instances from a case class for http://jsonapi.org format.
  *
  * The JsonApiFormat it self is not yet complete. The read side returns Nothing (???) and thus will crash with [[scala.NotImplementedError]]
  *
  * In the case class you have to provide 2 implicits after of which you can create an instance of the JsonApiFormat or JsonApiWriter.
  * Example for a case class called Individual.
  * {{{
  * implicit val individualResourceType: ResourceType[Individual] = "individuals"
  * implicit val individualPathTo: PathTo[Individual] = new PathTo[Individual] {
  *   private[this] val root = Path("/individuals")
  *   override final def self(id: String): Path = root / id
  * }
  * // After these you can generate the format like this
  * implicit val individualJsonFormat: JsonApiFormat[Individual] = jsonApiFormat[Individual]
  * }}}
